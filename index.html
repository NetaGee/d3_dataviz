      <p id="occ_text">Professional occupations, those that require higher education, tend to have higher median weekly earnings than non-professional occupations. In this way, higher education can serve as a key to a financially successful career path. However, if you're a woman, your gender may limit your financial success regardless of your educational attainment. The gender wage gap, or the difference between the earnings of a female and male in the same occupation, exists in every major occupation type. Men are typically paid higher earnings even in female-dominated occupations such as healthcare, education, and sales and office <em>(size of dot corresponds to number of workers)</em>. Since a greater proportion of women have Associate's degrees and above, it may be that women who are more qualified than men in their occupation still earn less for discriminatory reasons.</p>
